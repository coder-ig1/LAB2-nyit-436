INTRODUCTION TO LAB#2
This MP will introduce the map/reduce computing paradigm. In essence, map/reduce breaks
tasks down into a map phase and a reduce phase. Running our computation within this
framework allows us to parallelize data processing, as we’ll see in a bit.
For this week, we’ll be doing all computation locally (on your laptop/computer/EWS). In the
future, we can take this same code and run it on larger datasets on our Hadoop cluster.
